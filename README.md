CoCo DoJo
=============

CMU | 12 April 2013

Demo
-------------
An online [Demo](http://cocodojo.meteor.com) is available.

Objective
-------------
The idea of Coco Dojo, an online code collaboration tool, came form us as our CMU SV Hackathon team of Coco Dojo won the competition with a prototype and has received a lot of support from the faculty and staff since.  Based upon the faculty’s recommendations we would like to continue this project.  The scope of the editor is clear, we also have a great vision for what Coco Dojo can help the engineers do. To fulfill our vision, the challenge is high. It includes all the current technology trends in industry, including distributed systems, synchronization, and cloud computing.  The idea came from us as we will also be the users. Therefore it really motivates the team by working on the tools that every team member will actually use.  The project itself is challenging and this is the last semester the team can work together within an academic setting.  We’re looking forward to keep working on this project and be able to finish this great project from inception to completion.
